## available items

1. hyprlock.conf
2. nwg-panel (day and top battery and network show.)
3. sddm theme may need some tweaking of main.qml because placing may not be ideal acc to math.

## what to expect
in this i just tried to match my hyprlock theme i wanted a sddm theme that looked like it.
then i added home widgets in nwg-panel to make a theme like that then.
i made an app launcher in same style.

### app-launcher
to launch it make script executable
and bind it to your hyprland keybind.
